# 🚚 LoadLinker — Where Loads Meet Wheels  

LoadLinker is a web-based logistics platform built with **Python (Flask/Django)**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **MongoDB/SQLAlchemy**.  
It connects **Load Owners, Truck Owners, and Drivers** in a single ecosystem, reducing manual communication, delays, and inefficiencies in traditional logistics systems.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate dashboards for Admin, Load Owner, Truck Owner, and Driver  
- **Load Management**: Load Owners can post and track loads easily  
- **Truck Management**: Truck Owners can register trucks and mark them available/unavailable  
- **Driver Profiles**: Drivers can maintain availability and accept/reject assignments  
- **Matching Algorithm**: Suggests the best truck option based on capacity, cost, and distance  
- **Secure Authentication**: Role-specific login & registration system  
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap 5 for mobile and desktop compatibility  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5  
- **Backend**: Python Flask / Django  
- **Database**: SQLite (for development) / PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login / Django Auth  
- **Deployment**: GitHub / Heroku / Docker (future plan)
